Carries out empirical mode decomposition of the provided function. Written following [Huang et al. (1998; RSPA 454:903)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998RSPSA.454..903E).

I wrote this to be used with the Astrophysically Robust Correction of [Roberts et al. (2013 MNRAS 435:3639)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.tmp.2261R). However, I wrote this as a standalone module so that it can be used separately if desired.

Please acknowledge R. O. Parke Loyd if you use this code in your research.
